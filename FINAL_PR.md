# Complete Development Pack for TimeCapsuleWriter

This PR adds multiple enhancements to the TimeCapsuleWriter project, providing a comprehensive set of features for testing, development, and content creation.

## Overview of Added Components

### 1. Model Benchmarking
- `bench_models.py` script to compare models side-by-side (TimeCapsuleLLM, Phi-3-mini, Mistral-7B)
- Performance metrics including speed, memory usage, and Victorian-style quality scoring
- Results can be saved to JSON for tracking improvements over time

### 2. Samples Collection Framework
- Organized structure for showcasing generated content
- `snapshot.py` utility to save and categorize outputs
- Directory structure for different generation modes
- Consistent naming conventions

### 3. Testing and CI/CD Pipeline
- Comprehensive pytest test suite for core functionality
- GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
- Coverage reporting setup
- Flake8 linting configuration

### 4. Community and Contribution Support
- Detailed contributor guidelines (`CONTRIBUTING.md`)
- Architecture documentation
- Issue templates for bug reports and feature requests
- PR template with checklist

### 5. Character Profiles Feature
- Support for including consistent characters in generated stories
- Example profiles for Victorian clerk and governess
- Command-line integration with all generation modes
- Documentation for creating custom character profiles

## Implementation Details

### Testing
- Unit tests for all core utilities
- Test fixtures for common testing scenarios
- Coverage reporting configuration

### Documentation
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` with detailed guidelines
- Architecture overview in `docs/architecture.md`
- Character profiles documentation in `docs/character_profiles.md`

### Character Profiles
- Character profiles stored in `prompts/characters/`
- Example profiles for clerk and governess
- Integration with all generation modes via `--characters` argument
- Utility for listing available profiles with `--list_characters`

## Usage Examples

### Model Benchmarking
```bash
# Run standard benchmark
python bench_models.py

# Benchmark specific models
python bench_models.py --models microsoft/phi-3-mini-4k-instruct mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2

# Save results and generated samples
python bench_models.py --output_file benchmarks.json --save_samples
```

### Character Profiles
```bash
# Generate a story with a clerk character
python main.py --characters clerk

# Use multiple characters
python main.py --characters clerk governess

# List available characters
python main.py --list_characters
```

### Snapshot Tool
```bash
# Save an existing output as a sample
python snapshot.py --input outputs/victorian_story_20251028_155517.txt --model "TimeCapsuleLLM" --mode "single" --seed 42

# Generate and directly save a new sample
python snapshot.py --generate --model "Phi3Mini" --mode "beats" --seed 123 --outline_file beats.yaml
```

## Testing
All tests can be run with:
```bash
pytest
```

## Next Steps
Future enhancements could include:
1. More sophisticated Victorian quality metrics
2. Web UI for generation and sample browsing
3. Fine-tuning capabilities
4. Advanced character interactions

## Notes
All components have been designed to be modular and maintainable, with thorough documentation and testing.
