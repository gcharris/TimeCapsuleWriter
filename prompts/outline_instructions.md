# Story Beat Planning Format

Your narrative should follow a 4-beat structure, with each beat building upon the previous one to create a cohesive Victorian-era short story. The structure should be provided in YAML format following this schema:

```yaml
title: "Title of the Story"
setting: "Brief description of the primary setting"
protagonist: "Brief description of the main character"
beats:
  - name: "Setup"
    description: "Establish the protagonist, setting, and initial situation"
    key_elements:
      - "Element 1 of the setup"
      - "Element 2 of the setup"
      - "Element 3 of the setup"
  
  - name: "Complication"
    description: "Introduce the central conflict or challenge"
    key_elements:
      - "Element 1 of the complication"
      - "Element 2 of the complication"
      - "Element 3 of the complication"
  
  - name: "Turn"
    description: "Show how the protagonist confronts the challenge"
    key_elements:
      - "Element 1 of the turn"
      - "Element 2 of the turn"
      - "Element 3 of the turn"
  
  - name: "Resolution"
    description: "Resolve the conflict and show the consequences"
    key_elements:
      - "Element 1 of the resolution"
      - "Element 2 of the resolution"
      - "Element 3 of the resolution"
```

## Guidelines

1. Each beat should flow naturally from the previous one.
2. Maintain period-appropriate elements, settings, and societal norms.
3. Key elements should be specific and actionable, not abstract.
4. Include sensory details and emotional states where appropriate.
5. Ensure the resolution aligns with Victorian literary sensibilities.

When generating from a logline, expand it into a complete 4-beat structure following this format.
