The clerk had not seen this kind of thing before. He had noticed this year’s rainstorm. He was dressed in a frock and a white shirt, and the face he saw was his own, too pale for him to understand what was happening. There were no words. The boy was not the type to use such language.

In an odd, slightly surreal scenario, the young man who had been so polite greeted Mrs. Wilmot, and he was wearing a black tie, a long sleeved top and a dark jacket. The boy’s father was a priest. His mother was a woman. They stood at a table near their window. It was dark. The boy was looking at his father, who was lying in bed, and the old woman was asleep.

“I hope you don’t mind if I talk to you about the rain. I’ve got a lot of work to finish, but I can’t help feeling sorry for myself for a time when I didn’t see you.”

Mr. Elias North nodded, and then said something to his father. “It seems to me you’re going to be very upset if I tell you that this is the worst possible place to have sex. I’ll go through your phone and find out what happened. And if I don’t find out by tomorrow, you’ll come back in two days.”

The old woman said nothing, except to say she would go to bed. Mrs. Wilmot turned around, and the old woman held her hand in her other, more modest way. “Do you think you might like me?” she asked.

“Yes, sir,” the boy replied. “I love you.”

“What’s wrong?” Mrs. Wilmot asked.
